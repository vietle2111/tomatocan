  <p>
    You have the right to withdraw your consent on providing us your personal data, at any time, and to ask us to
    erase your data.
    You may ask to see your data that you gave to us, and thus to exercise your right to access data.
    If it happens that data you gave us is incorrect from any reason, you may ask for rectification of your data.
    You also have the right to ask for restriction of access to your data, in which case the data shall not be
    erased, but just access thereto shall be denied.
    Where you consented to give us data, or we process your data on the grounds of contract with you, if the
    processing is carried out by automated means, you may request that we send your data back in a structured way,
    and thus exercise your right to data portability.
  </p>
  <p>
    How We Use and Share the Information<br>
    We use the Personal Information, the Order Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information
    (collectively, the “Information”) to provide our services; to process Orders; to administer rewards and
    promotional programs; to maintain and improve ThinQ.tv and services to you; to solicit your feedback; and to
    inform you about our products and services.<br>
    ThinQ.tv will access, use, and share the Information as required to process your Orders and provide support to
    you. When you place an order, the information you enter for enabling fulfillment is sent to the Storyteller
    offering the item you purchased.<br>
    With your permission, third-party applications or services may access your Personal Information. We use standard
    OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your Personal Information with other
    websites and services, such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow
    another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information
    about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.<br>
    We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing
    technical assistance, Order fulfillment, customer service, and marketing assistance. These other companies will
    have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by
    law.<br>
    In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors, customers, and our products and services, we may analyze
    the Order Information and Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve
    ThinQ.tv and/or our products and services. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may
    share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated
    user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and
    to other third parties for other lawful purposes.<br>
    We may share some or all of your Information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or
    other companies under common control with us.
    As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale,
    merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the
    transferred assets.<br>
    To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the Information: (i) when required by law, court order, or
    other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing
    such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of
    ​RoleModel Enterprises, LLC, or others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information You Share<br>
    Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your Personal Information available to third parties —
    for example on message boards or web logs; through email; during webinars, classes, telephone conferences, or
    coaching calls; or in comment or chat areas — that information can be seen, collected, heard, and/or used by
    others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    How We Protect the Information<br>
    We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
    disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We
    cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the Information that you supply will
    not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or
    from ThinQ.tv may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you
    send to us via email.
