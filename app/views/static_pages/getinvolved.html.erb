        Being a woman or minority in engineering or tech requires moxie. Coworkers and management often overlook our contributions. We have to constantly be alert because no one else is looking out for us. On ThinQ.tv, women & minorities are the Role Models.

    Our Story
  </h1>
    <p class = "black">
      Back when ThinQ.tv Founder & Software Engineer, Dr. Lisa Schaefer, lived in Washington, DC, she attended a meeting where Biz Stone, the founder of Twitter, spoke. All she could thinQ of during the entire meeting was, "I can come up with something better."<br><br>

      Years earlier, Dr. Schaefer had a vision for multi-location book party with hundreds of intellectual conversations to drop in to and discovered live-streaming in its early days. "This changes everything," she thought. Anyone with a computer, webcam, and internet connection can communicate with anyone with anyone else who has an internet connection.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer developed her own web platform, embedded video chat, and experimented with talk show formats. Most were awful. People wanted to talk at the internet without listening to others in a dialogue. However the thought-provoking conversations that followed were worth coming back for.

      When COVID19 hit, college students gathered on ThinQ.tv to talk about substantive topics such as feminism and Black Lives Matter, while learning web development with Dr. Schaefer as their mentor. She asked the students to work on code in chatrooms on ThinQ.tv. We now have student in our chatrooms 8 - 12 hours per day. Anyone is welcome to Drop In to find out what we're up to - come to share ideas, collaborate on learning, and create tech. <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer's passion for activism is Coding While Female, which combines the interests - feminism & tech mentoring - of the students that joined ThinQ.tv this summer. ThinQ.tv is gathering women and minorities in STEM fields to host Mentor Hours on ThinQ.tv so they can be seen as Role Models in society, and so the future generation of STEM professionals can more easily find a source of expertise to turn to.
